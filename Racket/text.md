There are many advantages to using a system that is able to modify the colors of the text, but the most important is that it allows the user to have a better experience when reading the text. This not only helps a developer to have a better experience when reading and writing code, but it could also help people that suffer the several conditions such as dyslexia, color blindness, and other visual impairments. This kind of project allows us to understand how such a "simple" idea can have a huge impact in the world. Furthermore, by deciding to use a language that is commonly used for learning the basics of code, we could utilize this system, to some degree, for educational purposes. Such as oriented new students in their first steps in the world of programming, by providing a tool that allows them to read, organize and comprehend their codes in a more factual way.

To develope this activity we were constantly using the functional paradigm mentality to find the ost direct way of executing our code. This process wasnt easy at first given that we were mostly oriented to programming wth variable. Nevertheless, once we undesrtood the  idea behind this pardigm we dsicover a great way of efficating code. Atfirst we had a code that used a sucession of regex replace.Regex functions to subtitute the elements. This idea worked, but once we analyzed the complexity it seemed pretty high. For this reason, instead of using a succession of regex replace functions, we leveraged the concept of Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) to construct a helper function. This fucntion allowed us to only run the replace function that were presented in each line. This way we were able to reduce the complexity of the code and make it more efficient.

Efficiency became a focal point during the development process. We understood the importance of writing code that performs optimally, even more when is a code that could be performing in real time in following iteration. Overall, our journey in this project exposed us to the advantage and tools of functional programming. We learned to think in terms of only parameteres and responses, which helped us develop more modular codes that otpmizie their storage managment. For future projects even if outside the functional paradigm, we will be implements solutions based on the recursive and modular thinking that we learned in this project.
